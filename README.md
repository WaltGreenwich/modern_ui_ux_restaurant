The site is fully responsive, ensuring an excellent user experience on any device.

Features:

- Responsive design: Tailwind CSS enables seamless adaptation across all screen sizes.
- Organized structure: Code and file organization are optimized for scalability and readability.
- This project showcases my ability to turn a visual concept into a fully functional, modern web interface. Any feedback is welcome!
