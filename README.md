This project is a website for Gericht Restaurant built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, based on a Figma design. 
The site is fully responsive, ensuring an excellent user experience on any device.

Features:

- Reusable components: Modular, reusable React components make it easy to expand and maintain.
- Responsive design: Tailwind CSS enables seamless adaptation across all screen sizes.
- Organized structure: Code and file organization are optimized for scalability and readability.
- This project showcases my ability to turn a visual concept into a fully functional, modern web interface. Any feedback is welcome!
